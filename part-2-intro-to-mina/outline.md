# Outline

TLDR;

* An overview of Mina protocol
* How's Mina different from other Layer 1s like Ethereum, Solana etc?
* A brief walkthrough of protocol architecture
* Highlight unique features of Mina



## An overview of Mina protocol

Introduce

* L1 blockchain based on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP)
* first cryptocurrency protocol with a succinct blockchain (22KB)
* secured by proof of stake (PoS) consensus called Ouroboros Samisika



## How's Mina different from other Layer 1s like Ethereum, Solana etc?

Elaborate more on each of the points above

* L1 blockchain based on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP)
* first cryptocurrency protocol with a succinct blockchain (22KB)
* secured by proof of stake (PoS) consensus called Ouroboros Samisika

A short section on how Mina is different from other ZK-based projects.



## A brief walkthrough of protocol architecture



Explain the entire infra by putting "Recursive composition of SNARKs" in focus.

* A refresher on how SNARKS work
* Elaborate on&#x20;
  * how recursing compositions of SNARKs work
  * how this makes Mina different from other Layer1s like Ethereum, Solana etc



## Highlight unique features of Mina



Elaborate on the unique use cases unlocked by Mina's different architecture

* Node can be run on a browser
* higher decentralisation
* privacy by default
